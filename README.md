# Static Motion

Make your static site from [Notion.so](notion.so) with the help of Netlify and Travis CI.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alanzchen/static-motion.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alanzchen/static-motion)

## Installation

How do I install thisâ€¦ **No! You do not need to install it on your machine.**

All you need is a Github account.

## Get Started

1. Fork this project.
2. Modify `conf.py` as needed.
3. Turn on Travis CI for your forked repository.
4. Get your access token at Netlify and set the following environment variable on Travis CI's setting page:
   - `ACCESS_TOKEN`: fill your Netlify access token.
     (Remember to secure it!)
   - `SITE_ID`: The "API ID" of your Netlify site.
5. Bang!

## Debugging

As [notion.so](notion.so) make changes to their template, this utility may break at any time.

Before you go, make sure you have:

- Python 3.6,


- the latest Google Chrome,
- a working `chromedriver` .

Once you are ready, clone this repo and cd into it. Install the dependency:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the static site generator.

```
python motion.py
```

## Known Issue

- Embedded elements might not work.
  - Embedded tweets are not working.
- Fonts in code blocks may flicker slightly.
- Pages with the same base url but with different hash cannot coexist in the same site.
